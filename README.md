### Hello!

I'm Basil Shaji. Myself a scholar at Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences. I'm currently doing my UG B.Tech, focusing on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Iâ€™ve got a good mix of theory and hands-on experience under my belt. Iâ€™m pretty comfortable with programming languages like Python, C, and SQL, which I use to explore cool new stuff like algorithms in AI and ML. Iâ€™m also into video analysis using NVIDIA DeepStream and OpenCV, where Iâ€™m always exploring the latest trends in visual data. On top of that, Iâ€™m familiar with tools like Scikit-learn and GIT, which help me work smoothly in a team and keep projects moving forward.
