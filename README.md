### Hey there!
This is the place where I showcase my developer side stuff 😆

I'm Basil Shaji. Myself a scholar at Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences. I'm currently doing my UG B.Tech, focusing on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I’ve got a good mix of theory and hands-on experience under my belt. I’m pretty comfortable with programming languages like Python, C, and SQL, which I use to explore cool new stuff like algorithms in AI and ML. I’m also into video analysis using NVIDIA DeepStream and OpenCV, where I’m always exploring the latest trends in visual data. On top of that, I’m familiar with tools like Scikit-learn and GIT, which help me work smoothly in a team and keep projects moving forward. I'm a Computer Vision (CV) enthusiast.

- 🔭 &nbsp;I’m currently working on something cool :wink:
- 🌱 &nbsp;I’m currently learning Liquid Neural Networks (LNN) 🫥
- 💬 &nbsp;Ask me about anything related to Deepstream/Python/Tao-Toolkit & Other CV stuff
- ⚡ &nbsp;Fun fact: I :heart: 🐱s and watching movies 🤣
